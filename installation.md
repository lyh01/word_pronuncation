Pyaudio depends on portaudio, which is a C module. Conda is probably the quickest way to install pyaudio using: conda install pyaudio -y<br>
<br>
MacOS can install portaudio with Brew: brew install portaudio<br><br>
If you need brew, then run: ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null<br>
